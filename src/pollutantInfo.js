These are tiny particals in the air that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when the levels are elevated. they can be a result of burning fosil fuel and chemical reaction.

While stratospheric ozone plays a crucial role in protecting us from the sun\'s harmful ultraviolet rays, tropospheric ozone is a pollutant and a major component of smog. It is formed through the reaction of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight. Breathing in high levels of ozone can cause respiratory issues, particularly for people with pre-existing respiratory conditions.'

They are released from a wide range of sources, including paints, solvents, cleaning agents, and industrial processes. VOCs contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone and can have adverse effects on human health, such as eye, nose, and throat irritation, respiratory issues, and in some cases, they can be carcinogenic.'

It can travel long distances through the atmosphere and contaminate water bodies, leading to the bioaccumulation of methylmercury in fish and other aquatic organisms. Methylmercury is highly toxic and can cause neurological damage in humans, particularly affecting the developing nervous system of infants and children.'

It is a toxic substance that can accumulate in the body over time, particularly affecting the nervous system. Exposure to lead can cause developmental delays in children, damage to the brain and kidneys, and other serious health problems.'
